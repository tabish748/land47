                                    <p>If you’re thinking of starting a blog of your own, but just don’t have a clue on
                                        what to blog about, then fear not!</p>

                                    <p>In this article, I have included a whole load of blog examples from a wide
                                        variety of different niches, all run on different blogging platforms like
                                        WordPress, Joomla! and Drupal.</p>

                                    <p>Since the beginning of the internet, millions and millions and millions of blogs
                                        have been created. Many have died due to lost interest or their owners giving up
                                        on the idea, while others have thrived and continue to grow, making money and
                                        earning their owners a steady income. It’s a constant evolution of content that
                                        keeps people coming back for more, especially if these blogs contact highly
                                        resourceful material that people find useful and interesting.</p>

                                    <h3>Want to Start Your Own Blog?</h3>

                                    <p>Remember that it doesn’t cost the earth to start your own blog. You can be up and
                                        running for as little as $2.95 p/m with Bluehost.</p>

                                    <p>Frugality blogs have really taken off in the past 3 years, mainly down to the
                                        state of the global economy. Saving money and being frugal with your wages is
                                        extremely popular as people have less and less money these days after paying
                                        rent, mortgage, bills etc. Creating a frugal / save money blog can also be a big
                                        earner for you, especially if you choose a good angle to take on this niche.</p>
